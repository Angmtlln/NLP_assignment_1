    "## Implement context-sensitive spelling correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement context-sensitive spelling corrector using N-gram language model. The idea is to compute conditional probabilities of possible correction options. For example, the phrase \"dking sport\" should be fixed as \"doing sport\" not \"dying sport\", while \"dking species\" -- as \"dying species\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to start is to analyze [Norvig's solution](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) and [N-gram Language Models](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving this task, we expect you'll face (and successfully deal with) some problems or make up the ideas of the model improvement. Some of them are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- solving a problem of n-grams frequencies storing for a large corpus;\n",
    "- taking into account keyboard layout and associated misspellings;\n",
    "- efficiency improvement to make the solution faster;\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Please don't forget to describe such cases, and what you decided to do with them, in the Justification section.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### IMPORTANT:  \n",
    "Your project should not be a mere code copy-paste from somewhere. You must provide:\n",
    "- Your implementation\n",
    "- Analysis of why the implemented approach is suggested\n",
    "- Improvements of the original approach that you have chosen to implement"
