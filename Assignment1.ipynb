    "## Implement context-sensitive spelling correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement context-sensitive spelling corrector using N-gram language model. The idea is to compute conditional probabilities of possible correction options. For example, the phrase \"dking sport\" should be fixed as \"doing sport\" not \"dying sport\", while \"dking species\" -- as \"dying species\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to start is to analyze [Norvig's solution](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) and [N-gram Language Models](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving this task, we expect you'll face (and successfully deal with) some problems or make up the ideas of the model improvement. Some of them are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- solving a problem of n-grams frequencies storing for a large corpus;\n",
    "- taking into account keyboard layout and associated misspellings;\n",
    "- efficiency improvement to make the solution faster;\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Please don't forget to describe such cases, and what you decided to do with them, in the Justification section.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### IMPORTANT:  \n",
    "Your project should not be a mere code copy-paste from somewhere. You must provide:\n",
    "- Your implementation\n",
    "- Analysis of why the implemented approach is suggested\n",
    "- Improvements of the original approach that you have chosen to implement"

    "## Justification for Implementation Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ### N-gram Dataset Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "    The big.txt corpus was chosen as the primary dataset for language modeling because it is a large text corpus containing a variety of English words and sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, fivegrams were extracted to improve the context-aware spelling correction. Higher-order n-grams provide more accurate predictions by considering a broader linguistic context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  ### Weighting of Different Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unigram probability: Used as a base frequency for words in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bigram probability: Given twice the weight of unigram probability to capture contextual relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Trigrams,Fivegrams: same\n",
    "\n",
    "    Levenshtein Distance: Subtracted from the score to penalize candidates with higher edit distances, ensuring that corrections remain phonetically and structurally close to the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Jaccard Similarity: Weighted positively to promote words with higher character overlap with the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ### Error Correction Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "    The editing distance (edits1, edits2). I borrowed these functions from Norvig, because I considered them necessary to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Incorrect keystrokes: Leads to typical typos due to the location of adjacent keys on a standard keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ### Sentence-Level Correction Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "    The words are corrected sequentially to ensure grammatical consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The previous and penultimate preceding words are passed to the correct_word() function so that the probability can be adjusted based on the n-gram scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ### Scoring Function and Candidate Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "    The scoring function provides a balance of n-gram probabilities, similarity measures, and error penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The candidate with the highest score will be selected as the best correction option, ensuring both grammatical accuracy and minimal deviation from the original word.\n",

    "My model performs better because it considers a wider range of cases, catching many common spelling mistakes and even some homophones. However, it's still not good enough—it struggles with subtle context-based errors and sometimes introduces mistakes while trying to correct others. While it improves basic spelling, it needs refinement to better handle small but important word choice errors (like too → to). Overall, it’s an improvement, but there’s still work to do before it feels truly reliable."
